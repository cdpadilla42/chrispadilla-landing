# Portfolio Site

## Classic HTML/SCSS/Javascript Home for My Works

Here lives the code for my portfolio site! It's primarily an SCSS project with light JS for fade-in scrolling effects.

Tech used:

-

## Vanilla JS - Intersection Observers

I enjoyed learning about and putting into practice JavaScript's built in Intersection Observer API to handle the fade-in events. These make for a very lightweight way to add animations when coupled with CSS.

## Responsive Design - SCSS

The site, like many of my projects, have been tested on different screen sizes to adjust positioning while still maintaining beautiful design. This is accomplished through flex-box and organized through Sass partials and nested properties.
